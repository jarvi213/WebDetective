WebDetective is an API web app designed to query multiple sources for information regarding missing persons or victims of crime. The goal of the app is to make researching cases and making connections easier for those looking to make a difference.

In the starting view, users are given a field to enter the name of the case or individual they'd like to research. They can choose between 10-20 results per source.
